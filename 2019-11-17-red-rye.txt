NOTES:
------

Mash came in right on temperature: 67C

Had to sparge a fair bit more than in the recipe, as forgot that grain holds liquid. Still, sparged up to 18.5L

Pre-boil Gravity: 1.029

Post-boil Volume: around 14 or 14.5L

Post-boil Gravity: 1.037

Pretty much spot on the measurements for 60% efficiency. Left a lot of crap at the bottom, around 3L, to get to the fermenter volume of 11L

Apparently having a thinner mash can increase efficiency. Could try 3L/kg next time?

Fermenting at around 20 C

Gravity coming out at around 1.01. Around 3.54% ABV. Lower than originally
planned but mainly because I screwed up the sparge volumes.

Very clear. Tastes pretty good, like a mild red ale.

Still fermenting, albeit slowly
