Using the Brewzilla Robobrewer for the second time, yayy!

Grains - 6.7kg

Mash
----
Mashing with around 24L water: 
  * 18L for mash thickness of 2.7L/kg 
  * 6L for the deadspace under the grains in the robobrewer; this will also allow us to start the sparging by circulating this extra-water and we will need less sparge water. 

Added 4ml (just under 1tsp) of lactic acid to the water in order to reduce the pH of the mash, i.e. make it more acidic. This is useful for a New England IPA, because the grains are light (not caramalt) and have lower acidity.

Heated the water to 73C and added the grains.

Mashing at 68C for 60 minutes.

Sparge
------
Added hops to the wart before sparging (that's off recipe):
14g Centennial 

Sparged with additional 6L of water @ 78C. Eneded up with have about 24L, don't know where it all went, maybe absorbed by the grains.

Pre-boil gravity: 1.057 which is slightly over (expected 1.055). 

Boil
----
Boiling for 40mins (we decided to end the boil early, as we didn't have much volume and wanted to keep the gravity). 
Not adding any hops at this stage.
Not adding any Irish Moss, because we want a hazy beer.

Whirpooling
-----------
30g centennial  @ 79C
4 min
25 g amarillo.  @ 76C
4 min
28 g challenger @ 74C

OG (after boil gravity): 1.061, efficiency 71%, it is fine :)

Ended up with 17.5L - 18L of beer.
