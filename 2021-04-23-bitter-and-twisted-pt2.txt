Using the Brewzilla Robobrewer for the fist time, yayy!

Grains - 4.34kg

Mash
----
Mashing with around 13L water (mash thickness of 3L/kg).

Heated the water to 74C and added the grains.

Mashing at 67C for 65 minutes.

Notes:
- [This blog post](https://www.thehomebrewforum.co.uk/threads/the-dummies-guide-to-brewzilla.89574/) 
has a good step by step guide to using Brewzilla.
- It takes about 40mins to heat up 15L of water to 80C in the kettle on the hob.

Sparge
------
Sparged up to 24.5L with 80C water.

Pre-boil gravity: 1.045 which is slightly over (expected 1.04). 

Boil
----
Boiling for 90mins, adding hops at intervals as per recipe.
Adding 1tsp of irish moss 15mins before the end of the boil, because there is a lot of grain residue in the liquid and we want a clear beer.

OG (after boil gravity): 1.054, efficiency 80%, very nice!!

Activity in the fermentor has slowed down significantly.
Gravity: 1.008 - this about what we expect (1.01) at the end of fermentation.

==========

No activity in the fermentor.
Final gravity: 1.009 - nice. That's closer to what we expect (1.01) at the end of fermentation.
ABV: 5.91 - more than we expected, but this is due to high mash efficiency.
Racked and dry hopped. We used 12g of Williamet and 4g of Bobek, because we had run out of Bobek.
Flavour is nice.

Bottling day.
Calculated priming sugar based on 2.3 volumes of CO2, in order to get carbonation that is a bit higher than for British Style Ales and at the low end for European Lagers).
Racked on top of the sugar solution before bottling.
Flavour is hoppier than before dry hopping and we like it and the clarity is good too.
