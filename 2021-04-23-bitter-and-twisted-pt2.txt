Using the Brewzilla Robobrewer for the fist time, yayy!

Grains - 4.34kg

Mash
----
Mashing with around 13L water (mash thickness of 3L/kg).

Heated the water to 74C and added the grains.

Mashing at 67C for 65 minutes.

Notes:
- [This blog post](https://www.thehomebrewforum.co.uk/threads/the-dummies-guide-to-brewzilla.89574/) 
has a good step by step guide to using Brewzilla.
- It takes about 40mins to heat up 15L of water to 80C in the kettle on the hob.

Sparge
------
Sparged up to 24.5L with 80C water.

Pre-boil gravity: 1.045 which is slightly over (expected 1.04). 

Boil
----
Boiling for 90mins, adding hops at intervals as per recipe.
Adding 1tsp of irish moss 15mins before the end of the boil, because there is a lot of grain residue in the liquid and we want a clear beer.

OG (after boil gravity): 1.054, efficiency 80%, very nice!!

Activity in the fermentor has slowed down significantly.
Measured gravity: 1.008 - this about what we expected at the end of fermentation.
