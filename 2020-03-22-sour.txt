250ml water
1g-to-10ml ratio DME: ~25 grams

Boiled water, added DME. Stirred. Left for 15 minutes.

Cooled. Added dregs of 3 beers:

* Timmermans Limited Edition Oude Krief (brewed 2012, bottled 2015)
* 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze Green Label (2016) 
* 3 Fonteinen Cuvee Armand & Gaston (2017)

Started bubbling really well after a few days. After a week on the counter, with lots of daily agitatint, stored in fridge for later due to logistics issues with
the brew store (bloody virus!)

Started brewing the lambic.

Mashed at around 3L/kg, at 69C. Added a little cold water to bring down the
mash temp. Leaving for 75 minutes.

Discarded most of the hooch from the lambic starter, swirled around and left
out of the fridge to bring up to room temperature.

Mash stayed at temperature for the 75 minutes.

Drained 6L wort.
Batch sparged with around 11L water, raising temperature to 75C
Batch sparged with around 8L water
Drained 23L wort

Brought up to boil.

Initially boiled for 100 m

Added 80g aged spalt hops. Unknown AA. Hopefully low

Boiled for an additional 60 m as volume was still high and thus gravity was low

Pitched the dregs. Good luck!

OG: 1.053, so slightly over. Shouldn't be a problem though.

Will hopefully bottle in 2 years. And mature for 4-6 months.
