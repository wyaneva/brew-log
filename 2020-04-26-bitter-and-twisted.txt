Mashing with around 5.7L water.

Mashed at 67C for 75 minutes.

Mashing came out low. Down to 63 at one point. Lots of trouble and bother while
sparging, trying to keep a good temperature. Don't open the mash next time. Also get a proper tun!

Pre-boil gravity came out at 1.026 which is slightly under but not too bad,
considering

Added 200g DME because of big cock-up.

OG: 1.034, so low!
